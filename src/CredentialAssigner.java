// Interfaces have fields that can be adopted by other classes. The use of interfaces
// is that a class can adopt MANY interfaces, not just one (ala parent classes)!

package sample;

public interface CredentialAssigner {
	boolean isDuplicate = true;   // DUMMY VALUES
	double userID = 1.0;          // DUMMY VALUES
	
	// Code to assign a randomized ID to every user
	
	
	// Code to check that this ID isn't a duplicate.
}
