 * Covered originally on Friday, just created on 10/01 today.
 * Current production number should be a class field.

 * ===Final project must meet:===
 * JavaDocs on everything
 * No bugs
 * No checkstyle [errors]
 *
 * Why was it telling us that manufacturer is in Product, not Item?
 * You can get the manufacturer from Item because Item is a class.
 *
 * Idea: They might down the road be wanting to change the product on a per-manufacturer basis.
